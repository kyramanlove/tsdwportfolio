## OECD General Government Debt Sparklines (1995-2018)
This grid of line charts displays the Debt-to-GDP ratio for different OECD member nations between 1995 and 2018. In recent years, most countries show only negligible gains or declines in debt, remaining stable overall. However, while most countries have sustainable debt levels, Japan and Greece both have high debt-to-GDP ratios, with Greece just under 200% debt-to-GDP and Japan at over 230% debt-to-GDP.

## OECD General Government Debt Heatmap (1995-2018)
This is a heatmap of the Debt-to-GDP ratio for different OECD member nations between 1995 and 2018. While the grid of line charts helps show overall trends in debt-to-GDP ratios, the heatmap helps hone in on specific years where factors in the larger economic environment are worth examining. This heatmap also helps better show when countries either surpass or dip below the 100% debt-to-GDP threshold. A key insight that I can see in this heatmap that is not readily seen in the grid of line charts is that 2008 and 2009 in particular resulted in many countries taking on more debt than their GDP, which makes sense given the Great Recession that affected many national economies due to the bursting of the housing bubble.
