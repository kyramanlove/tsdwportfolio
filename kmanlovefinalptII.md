# Telling Stories with Data Final Pt II

## Wireframe 

### Intro
Technology has disrupted the entertainment industry in many ways. We have endless content at our fingertips, all packaged in a user-friendly format: streaming. With the removal of physical limitations and a new method of monetization, streaming is influencing not just end-user listening habits, but the whole structure of popular music. 

### Background
The paid subscription model of streaming began rising to prominence in the mid-2000s, with Spotify debuting in 2008. This format now generates the majority share of revenue in the recorded music industry. 
* Visualization here is a stacked bar chart of music industry revenues by format. 

And the volume physical and digital sales are dropping each year. 
* Visualization; line chart of sales since 2008 (Spotify invented) 

While paid subscription continues to grow. 
* Visualization; line chart of subscription growth for Spotify and Apple Music (leading two services). 

With this major trend from a sales-based model to a subscription-based model, the way musicians are able to make money off their songs has changed. Explain here that 30s counts as a listen. 
* Visualization here. This will be a horizontal bar graph with 5-7 popular songs listed on the y-axis of varying length. The x-axis will be time in seconds. Then there will be a line highlighting the 30s mark and noting that that is $$$. So in other words, a 5min song makes the same about of money as a 2min song. 

Streaming is less profitable too. (Need to find a good dataset for this. Essenitally, the profits are so small that volume really matters here). 

### Trends
And so, this new model of monetization has resulted in some interesting trends in the industry. 

We will be specifically analyzing popular music, defined as songs that have had success on the Billboard Hot 100, to reflect music that is more commercialized. 

Because a song that is 5min long is worth the same as 2min long, we've seen a shift in song length in popular songs. 
* Visualization of the average length of a song on the Billboard Hot 100 per calendar year
* Visualization of the share of songs under 2:30 

We can also see this trend across albums as well. 
* Refer to Quartz illustration 


We are no longer constrained by physical limitations, so albums may get longer and longer just stuffed with shorter tracks. Point to Drake playlist example. 
* Visualization of time limit for physical formats (vinyl, cassette, CD vs. unlimited for digital) 

We can even see this trend in song structure, where popular songs disrupt the intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format to begin with a chorus to hook listeners quicker in those first 30s. 

Trend is likely to continue, with the impact of Tik Tok and videos being constrained to one minute. (Find something to illustarte how Tik Tok has impacted the Hot 100? Idk) 

### CTA 
As a music industry professional, it's all about earworms and hooks and brevity. 

As a casual music listener or buyer, if you want to support your favorite artists listen to all their songs for 30s at a time lol. Or in addition to your streaming consumption, which doesn't bring in that much money, support with merchandise and concert tickets. 

Offer resources for additional reading such as NYT, Switched on Pop, other data idk.
